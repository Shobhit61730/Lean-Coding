Hacktoberfest2021     Automate with code üìÉ üè∑Ô∏è Automate some boring stuff using your favourite programming language.  How to contribute? Add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file. Create the folder of your preferred language if not present and add your code within a folder or as a file. üöÄ Quick Start : 1: Forking the repository : Get your own local copy of the repository by clicking on Fork button at right upper corner.   2: Clone the Forked Repository To make your local copy of the repository follow the steps:  Open the Command Prompt Type this command: $ git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-github-username>/Automate-with-code 3: Creating a new branch Branching helps managing your code and isolate your work. To create a new branch:  $ git branch &lt;branch_name> $ git checkout -b &lt;branch_name> Keep your cloned repository upto to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)  git pull origin main 4: Contribute Commit your code in your branch using below steps:  First stage your changes,  git add . Commit your code with appropriate message,  git commit -m "commit message" At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:  git push origin &lt;branch-name> 5: Create Pull Request Now, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.  You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the "Compare &amp; pull request" button on the page.  GitHub will alert you that you can merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a title, a comment, and then press the ‚ÄúCreate pull request‚Äù button.
